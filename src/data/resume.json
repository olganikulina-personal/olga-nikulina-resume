    "about": "Hello and welcome, I'm Olga. I learned software development over several years, while working as a QA, by reading the code and tracking down where bugs occurred. I've moved from QA, to software development, to leading a team of developers. I pride myself on being organized, detail-oriented, and thoroughly researched. Before jumping into a project I like to ask tons of questions to better understand scope, estimates, and potential gaps. As lead, I split my time between administrative tasks while also prioritizing keeping my hands on the keyboard, to ensure I remain knowledgeable of the code so as to best support my team."
